intro: |
  Unicorns are mythological creatures but are now synonyms for rare and highly desirable
  qualities. Being an openly Trans Non-Binary person in the coding world, I am rare and often the only one like me in groups talking about data science. 
  
  I am not a startup company from the Sillicon Valley or a level 10 coder, just a 
  coder who is one of a small group of Trans coders in the world.
